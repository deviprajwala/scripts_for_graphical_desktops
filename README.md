# scripts_for_graphical_desktops
In this repositary we have made use of various packages available for the user interface.Here we generate a menu which has four options
such as to view the diskspace , to view the logged on users , to view the memory usage and the last one is exit.These four functions are 
common in all the menu.
One of the menu is built by simple commands without the use of any package the other one follows the same but we have made use of select 
command.The rest of the menu's are built by using the various packages such as dialog,kdialog and zenity.One scripts among them describes the 
use of various widgets available in dialog.
There are many options available out of which only few are used in the scripts.
